Hello all! My IGN is BeeHappy88 and I am a beginner in the coding world. I have been studying courses on Codecademy as well as Scrimble in order to learn how to be a Front End Web Developer. My work history is pretty spotty, especially as of 2019 when I started getting intense, debilitating migraines that kept me from functioning.

I only have a basic knowledge of HTML5, CSS, and Javascript right now with vague familiarity about  PHP, SQL, and Python. I know what some things are, but I don't know them myself.

On this Git, you will see my progress from "Just Starting Out" to "This is My Best Project Currently". I'm hoping to use this to get my Portfolio started for the future. In the meantime, I'll be continuing my journey on Codecademy and other similar coding tutorials/libraries.
